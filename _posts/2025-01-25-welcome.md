Hello world! This is the first post on my new blog. I decided to build this site to have a place where I can share my thoughts and projects.

## Why a Blog?

I believe that writing is the best way to clarify thinking. By sharing what I learn, I hope to help others and also solidify my own understanding.

## The Tech Stack

This site is built with:
- **Jekyll**: A simple, blog-aware, static site generator, default from Github. 
- **GitHub Pages**: Free hosting directly from my GitHub repository.
- **Custom CSS**: Designed from scratch with a focus on aesthetics and readability.
